## realsense-test

The **`realsense-test`** application is a simple tool to verify the functioning of the attached Realsense camera device. It can be seen as a unsophisticated alternative to the `realsense-viewer` application. The application simply opens windows for RGB, depth and infrared images, while it opens a PCL viewer application for monitoring the point cloud output generated by the `Realsense` driver class in the `PerceptionCapture` library. We can choose to disable/enable the output formats we choose to view.



The application can be launched with the following command,

``` sh
YARP_ROBOT_NAME=iCubGazeboV2_5 realsense-test --from blf-realsense-pointcloud-test-options.ini
```



The parameters  listed in `blf-realsense-pointcloud-test-options.ini` the configuration file for launching the application are,
